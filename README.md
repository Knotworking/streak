# streak

Flutter sandbox app to record daily habit streaks.

## Stopping development

I originally started writing this app for my girlfriend, so that I could add custom features that existing habit apps don't have. However she has an iPhone, and I only discovered after starting development that without a paid Apple developer account the app can't remain valid on her device forever (unlike Android).

I'll keep this project here for my own reference. Maybe I'll pick it up again some day.
